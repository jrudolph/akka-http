# Release Notes

## 10.0.3

See the [announcement](http://akka.io/news/2017/01/26/akka-http-10.0.3-released.html) and
closed tickets on the [10.0.3 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/milestone/19?closed=1).

This release contains mostly bug fixes, a huge number of contributed documentation fixes and
small improvements.

### HttpApp

A notable new feature is the experimental `HttpApp` feature (long time users may know it from spray). It allows
to create an Akka HTTP server with very little boilerplate. See its @ref[Java](java/http/routing-dsl/HttpApp.md)
and @ref[Scala](scala/http/routing-dsl/HttpApp.md) documentation. Thanks a lot, [@jlprat](https://github.com/jlprat) for
contributing this feature and carrying through the PR with the most comments so far.

### Changed semantics

In some cases, we need to change semantics slightly to fix bugs. Some user code may still rely on the
previous behavior so we are listing them here to bring attention to potential issues.

 * `Uri.Authority.toString` now doesn't render leading double slashes any more ([#784](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/784))
 * request URIs for requests coming in for a server set up to use TLS now carry the `https` scheme ([#658](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/658))
